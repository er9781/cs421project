Tables USER and ALERT use CHECK keyword in order to put constraints on USER.role and ALERT.type.
the check on USER.role is to ensure that user can be somehow initialized other than 'admin' or 'user',
this streamlines the query process and ensure DB integrity. The CHECK on ALERT.type is very similar,
but it ensures that type is a part of a pre-defined list, again this streamlines querying.
