For our database population we decided to use JDBC to manage automatic data generation. Any decent
technology company needs to be able to generate mock data in order to run tests/analysis within the
context of their company. We have created infrastructure that uses seeding based on config variables
to create actionable data. We used these seeds to generate random sql statements that do various jobs
for this assignment. This code greatly reduces the time needed to populate entire tables or even to
slightly modify them. The source files for the java code are located in src/main.
