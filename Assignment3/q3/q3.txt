Useful Indexes:

CREATE INDEX URL ON MENU_ITEM(URL);

This is an index created on the URL attribute of the MENU_ITEM table. It is useful
for quickly selecting all or specific URL's that one or all pages employ. SELECT 
FROM WHERE statements would experience a speed up when targeting URL's. Since 
MENU_ITEM is not a small table and it is not updated/manipulated often, it is 
a good candidate for indexing.

CREATE INDEX USER_NAME ON USER(NAME, ROLE) CLUSTER;

This creates an index on the NAME and ROLE attributes in USER in a clustered format.
This is useful because queries based on users benefit greatly from groupings
and locality. For instance using a WHERE clause in conjunction with a '>' or '<'
operator can be used to get all names within a specific alphabetical order and/or 
role. This index will greatly speed up these types queries by taking advantage of
the positive effects of clustering for grouping operations, ordering operations,
and string comparisons (other than equal).

CREATE INDEX TITLE_PAGE ON PAGE(TITLE, IS_PUBLIC) CLUSTER;

This index is very similar to the one above in that it will take advantage of
groupings and locality, but it focuses on the PAGE table, specifically which PAGE
records are accesible by everyone. This is very useful when using a SELECT to
display all pages with or without some search parameters on TITLE.
